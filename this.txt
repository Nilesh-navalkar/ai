The task of face recognition has been actively researched in recent years. This paper provides an up-to-date review of major human face recognition research. We first present an overview of face recognition and its applications. Then, a literature review of the most recent face recognition techniques is presented. Description and limitations of face databases which are used to test the performance of these face recognition algorithms are given. A brief summary of the face recognition vendor test (FRVT) 2002, a large scale evaluation of automatic face recognition technology, and its conclusions are also given. Finally, we give a summary of the research results.
Scholarcy Synopsis
In the world of machine learning, deep learning has made its significant impact in certain tasks which seemed impossible a few years ago such as lip reading and speech recognition.

Programmed lip-perusing innovation is one of the significant segments of humanâ€“computer cooperation innovation.
It assumes a fundamental job in human language correspondence and visual recognition.
Three different approaches were discussed for lip reading, and it comes with its own advantages and disadvantages.
The proposed solution for the problem was to adopt bottom-up approach which overcomes the weaknesses of image-based feature extraction.

6 speakers were included in the research. 

The researchers recommend that a CNN has the potential to acquire a speaker independent model for the VSR task.
Future work is to investigate the possibility of building a speaker-independent phoneme recognition model by preparing a larger dataset.
